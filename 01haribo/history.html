			<h1>1920 - 
Founding the Company</h1>
			<p>Hans Riegel, born in 1893 in Friesdorf near Bonn completed training as a confectioner when he finished school. He worked for Kleutgen & Meier as well as in factories in Neuss and Osnabrück.

After the First World War, Hans Riegel became a partner in the company Heinen in Bonn-Kessenich which subsequently became Heinen & Riegel. But by 1920, Hans Riegel had started out with a company of his own. Hans Riegel purchased a house in Bergstrasse in Kessenich, at the time a suburb of Bonn, and set up the first factory there. The starting capital was a sack of sugar, a marble block, a stool, a brick oven, a copper kettle and a roller.

Here in a small backyard laundry-kitchen, began the history of the now world-famous company. On December 13, 1920, Hans Riegel had the company name HARIBO® entered in the trade registry of the city of Bonn as an acronym of HAns RIegel BOnn. In 1921, Hans Riegel married his wife Gertrud and she became the first employee in the young company.

			<h2>~ 1922 ~ </h2>
<h1>The DANCING BEAR is born</h1>
			<p>In 1922, Hans Riegel layed the first foundation stone for the subsequent international success of the company HARIBO®. He invented the DANCING BEAR - a bear-shaped figure made from gummi which would later be world famous as the legendary HARIBO GOLD-BEAR®. This DANCING BEAR was inspired by the trained bears that were a fixed part of the festivities at annual markets and other celebrations well into the 19th century in Germany.<br><br>
				The DANCING BEARS made from gummi were larger than the GOLD-BEARS® are today, but slimmer. Quickly the DANCING BEARS and the SWEET DEVILS became the classics of the HARIBO range. Two DANCING BEARS cost just a pfennig in inflation-wracked Germany.

			<h1>The thirties
The TEDDY BEAR and a fantastic advertising slogan</h1>
			<p>By 1930, HARIBO® had 160 employees and a comprehensive sales organisation made up of trade representatives supplied all of Germany with HARIBO products.</p><br>
			<span>In the thirties, the HARIBO product range added another relative of the DANCING BEAR: the TEDDY BEAR. This bear was smaller and rounder and represented the edible version of the popular cuddly toy. The TEDDY BEARS were named after the 26th president of the US (1901–1909), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) who was a passionate hunter with a particular penchant for bears. At official events, he was often presented with toy bears which soon became known as TEDDY BEARS after the short form of his name.</span>
